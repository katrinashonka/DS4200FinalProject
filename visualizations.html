      Below are our 5 data visualizations.  
      Some will have interactive elements to help you explore the data in depth.  
      Explanations of design decisions will be documented separately.

        To better understand which demographics are most affected, this interactive histogram seeks to identify which age groups and genders experience the most panic attacks. By using the dropdown menu, the age data of either male or female patients can be observed.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the ages of male patients, there is a normal distribution centered about the 40–45-year-old age band; this indicates that while panic attacks affect male adults of all ages, they are most frequent among middle-aged males.
      </p>
      <p>
        The distribution of ages for female patients is a little different. Instead of a normal distribution, there is a slight left skew in the data, with the 50–55-year-old females being the age group with the most panic attacks. This suggests that older females (aged 50+) are more at risk for panic attacks than younger females.

  <h3>2. Grouped Bar Chart: Therapy/Medication Impact</h3>
  <p>
    This chart compares different combinations of therapy and medication
    on panic severity levels (Low, Medium, High).

    <p>
      This grouped bar chart is a static plot that divides the patients in the dataset based on which therapeutic interventions they have received. The proportions of patients who experience low, medium, and high-severity panic attacks within each therapeutic intervention group are shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all four groups, the high-severity panic attacks are always the most frequent type of attack, regardless of whether patients have therapy, medication, both, or neither. Interestingly, patients who are taking medication (regardless of whether they also have therapy) have the highest percentages of high-severity panic attacks (>40%); this suggests that patients who are most at risk for extremely severe panic attacks are more commonly prescribed medication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, the only group with over 30% of its patients reporting low-severity panic attacks was the group with neither therapy nor medication. This provides more evidence to suggest that patients with milder panic attacks are less likely to receive mental health treatment.

      <!-- Visualization 3: Scatterplot (D3) -->
      <div class="viz-container">
        <h3>3. Normalized Stacked Bar Chart (Altair) - Panic Severity</h3>
        <p>
          An interactive normalized stacked bar chart to visualize the relationship between panic attack 
          severity and symptoms and lifestyle factors.
        </p>
        <iframe 
          src="altair_stress_proportion.html"

          style="border: none;">
          </iframe>
          <p>
          This visualization reveals that both lifestyle factors and physical symptoms are closely tied to the severity of stres
          -induced panic attacks. Poor lifestyle habits—particularly low sleep and high alcohol consumption—are associated with a
          greater proportion of high-severity panic episodes. Similarly, symptoms like chest pain, sweating, and dizziness tend
          to occur more frequently during severe attacks. Together, this suggests that both preventative habits and symptom
          awareness play critical roles in understanding and managing panic severity.
