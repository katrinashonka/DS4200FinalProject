        In summary, this project aims to provide insights into panic attacks, their triggers, and potential lifestyle factors that may influence severity. We first found that although male and female adults of all ages experience panic attacks, panic attacks are most common among middle-aged and older males, as well as older females. Second, we looked at how lifestyle factors and different triggers impacted the severity of panic attacks. Overall, these charts suggested a mix of physiological (heart rate, sleep quality) and lifestyle factors (alcohol, caffeine) play key roles in both the severity and duration of panic episodes. Finally, through our analysis of the impacts of therapy and medication on panic attack severity, we determined that medication reduces highly severe panic attacks, and a combination of therapy and medication can reduce all types of panic attacks. Targeting the key areas identified, for instance moderating caffeine and alcohol intake, or receiving targeted intervention like medicine and therapy may help reduce the intensity and duration of panic attacks.

        Future work may include deeper analysis of co-occurring mental health conditions, longitudinal studies on therapy/medication effectiveness, and the integration of real-time monitoring data for more accurate predictions and visualizations.
